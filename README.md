INTRODUCTION
------------
This is an small self programmed framework based on PHP and the Template Machine Smarty.
It intends to give the possibility to use a PHP-Framework for small applications,
like personal web sites, however could be used for mittle applications as well.
The architecture of the framework is based on the MVC (Model View Controller) Design Pattern.

I have tried to write an easy readable code as I could. It could be easy extended and maintained.

- PHP 5.*
